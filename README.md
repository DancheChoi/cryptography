# Cryptography
I have a particular interest in cryptography but not such a bugchecker (those annoying bugs). Please help me (and help in my projects). 


**Projects**
1. 'Engima' - a python module I am creating that encrypts or decrypts by converting letters between the alphabet and the 'QWERTY' layout.
2. **NOTHING YET**
